## description
We work in a 2D grid defined length and width of cells.
At each step, the evolution of a cell is determined by the state of its 8 neighbors as follows:
- a dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive
- a living cell with 3 or 2 living neighbors stay alive else it become a dead cell
